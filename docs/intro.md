# Installation

## Marketplace

You can grab a copy of the module on the [Marketplace](https://create.roblox.com/marketplace/asset/7933448750).

## GitHub Release

You can also obtain a copy of the module from [GitHub](https://github.com/Blupo/Color/releases).

## Submodule

Color can be included as a Git submodule and synced with [Rojo](https://rojo.space). The [`main`](https://github.com/Blupo/Color/tree/main) branch is the version of the module on the marketplace and in the latest release. The [`develop`](https://github.com/Blupo/Color/tree/develop) branch contain in-developments code, which you can use for experimenting API changes, but things may change rapidly between commits.

Make sure to update your Rojo configuration to point to the module.

## Manual Build

If you know how to use [Rojo](https://rojo.space), you can build the module yourself. [`default.project.json`](https://github.com/Blupo/Color/blob/develop/default.project.json) is used for building the module as an asset, while [`place.project.json`](https://github.com/Blupo/Color/blob/develop/place.project.json) is used for testing the module in Studio.
